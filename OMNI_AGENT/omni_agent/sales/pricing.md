## Ideal customer profile

| Tier | Who |
|---|---|
| **Free** | Solo operators trying Omni-Agent on a side repo. Proof-of-concept buyers. |
| **Pro** | Indie founders, solo CTOs, and tech-leads who bought an LLM key and want a real execution loop sitting on top of it. They have a messy `TODO.md` they want to close. |
| **Team** | 5–30 person engineering orgs running a shared inbox of backlog tasks across 2–5 repos. Typically Series-Seed to Series-B SaaS teams with a Linear/Jira + GitHub stack. |
| **Enterprise** | Compliance-sensitive orgs (fintech, health, defense, or any team with a black-box policy requirement). They need self-host, SSO, and policies-as-code. Also: agencies running it as managed-service for their clients. |

---

## Upgrade triggers (what makes a customer move up a tier)

| From → To | Trigger |
|---|---|
| Free → Pro | First time they hit the 25-tasks/month cap, or they want an LLM-powered Analyst/Developer/Evaluator instead of rule mode. |
| Pro → Team | Second seat requested, or they want Slack/Linear/GitHub webhooks so the team can see runs without logging into the CLI. |
| Team → Enterprise | Legal asks for SSO + audit export, or procurement requires self-host, or they want custom guardrail policies (e.g., "services X and Y may never touch schema migrations"). |

## What's NOT in Free

- Hybrid/LLM personas (rule-mode only).
- Client Reports, ROI Tracker, PR Autopilot.
- No history beyond 30 days.
- No priority support — GitHub issues only.

_Why:_ Free exists to prove the loop works on your repo. The three monetized modules above are the reason teams pay.
